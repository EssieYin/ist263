      <h2>The Golden Fourty Years</h2>
        <p>
          During the golden age, Hong Kong pop music rode on the fast train of TV dramas and movies, and became widely popular not only in mainland China, but also throughout Asia. Today, as one of the major branches of Chinese pop music, Cantonese-pop (i.e. Cantonese pop music) has been developed for more than 40 years, providing countless excellent musical talents to the Chinese music scene and giving birth to countless excellent classics that have made the common memories of several generations.
        </p>

        <div class = "multimedia">
            <img src="../prijmedia/xuguanjie.jpeg" alt="Sam Hui">

            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1Q1wqjzUrLPcJFGAIJ9q04?utm_source=generator&theme=0" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
          In 1974, Sam Hui released the Cantonese album "Ghost Horse Double Star", which sold over 150,000 copies in Southeast Asia, and the title track of the same name, written by himself, became the first Chinese song to be played on BBC radio in the UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the door of Cantonese pop songs was opened, a group of outstanding musicians emerged to join in the creation of Cantonese songs, including James Wong and Gu Jiahui. The former wrote a number of masterpieces such as "A Smile in the Sea" and "Men Should Be Strong", while the latter was the author of "Shanghai Tang" and "A Thousand Mountains is Always Love".
        </p>

        <p>
          The lack of excellent music creators in the Hong Kong pop music industry was gradually made up for by this group of musicians, and the situation that local pop singers had to rely on covers of Japanese, Taiwanese, European and American tracks to become popular was gradually improved. It was also this group of musicians with high production and quality creation that determined the main trend of pop music in the Hong Kong music scene afterwards, laying the foundation for the development and peak of Cantonese-pop.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the mid-1980s, Hong Kong entered a period of capitalist industrialization and was officially named the "Four Little Dragons of Asia", having fully adapted to the westernized consumer social environment. The high level of economic development gave rise to a high demand for spiritual consumption, and it was at this time that the commercial and industrialized character of Hong Kong pop music became more and more evident and entered a strong phase of booming development.
        </p>

        <p>
          The music industry began to fist-bump the concept of star-making, and Asia's first idol industry came into being. The record companies led by East Asia Records and Emperor Entertainment became the giants of integrated entertainment production. They packaged and built pop songs and singers themselves in the form of brands and adopted a standardized and modern operation model for unified management, which produced many idol singers including Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui in just a few years. The famous Tam and Cheung rivalry in music history also kicked off from there.

        </div>

        <p>
          During this period, pop star concerts, karaoke and laserdiscs became the most prevalent trendy culture and the most popular form of consumption among the locals in Hong Kong. It is recorded that from 1983 to 1989, the number of local pop music concerts held at the Hung Hom Coliseum surged from 18 to 129, and the number of attendees also increased from 150,000 to a staggering 1.35 million within the same period. Hong Kong pop music officially entered the era of superstars with a wealth of talent.
        </p>

        <p>
          During this period, the powerful vocalists, including Jay Kwan, Xu Xiaofeng and Yanni, and the full-fledged singer-songwriters, led by Beyond, Sam Hui and Chan Pak Keung, also emerged. Although their performance in the market could not compete with the aforementioned idols, their rich and diverse composing styles and singing genres collaborated to create the blossoming of the Hong Kong music scene, making Canton-pop vibrant and vital.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1989, Leslie Cheung announced his temporary retirement from the singing industry; in 1992, Andy Hui and Anita Mui also announced their temporary retirement. Hong Kong's well-developed radio industry is not willing to be lonely, the original will be Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Lai Ming, Aaron Kwok four singers collection bundle, which created the famous "Four Kings" brand in Asia.

        <p>
          Subsequently, female singers such as Faye Wong, Sammi Cheng and Kelly Chen also began to top half of the sky, and the new wave of divas possessed an even more far-reaching influence than before. The reason is that at that time, it coincided with the reform and opening up of China and the return of Hong Kong and Macao between two important points, the Hong Kong music industry entered the mainland in a big way, and Hong Kong pop singers set off an unprecedented phenomenon of idol worship in the mainland, triggering a chain of commercial effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The heat of the idol-making era has not yet dissipated, and a new batch of pop singers such as Eason Chan, Joey Yung and Leo Ku have emerged. On the other hand, although not on par with their predecessors, Nicholas Tse and the girl group Twins have finally taken the baton of idolatry and are quite popular in the market created by the previous generation of superstars.

        <p>
          At that time, the age group of Hong Kong pop music listeners had become significantly divided, with teenagers becoming the main group of pop music consumers. The romanticism of these groupies also dictated that this new generation of pop singers mainly sang love songs, with very delicate and sensual singing and a personal performance full of fashion. Until now, the works of Hong Kong's top pop singers still more or less reveal such a style.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most important contributors to the creation of this youthful taste of Canton-pop is Hong Kong's Radio 903. It calls itself a youth radio station, presenting a very different orientation from the wireless and RTHK, keen to support the promotion of unknown independent musicians. From Eason Chan, Miriam Yeung to Khalil Fong, all of them have been loved by 903 and its listeners - as it seems, 903 is still accurate as a touchstone.

        <h2>Behind the glamour: Canton-pop's internal and external worries</h2>

        <p>
          We all understand the principle that the peak is bound to decline, but no one thought that for Canton-pop would come so quickly. Now, more than forty years later, let's not mention how many top pop singers exist in the Hong Kong music scene, even the Top Ten Chinese Golden Melody Awards, Top Ten Golden Melody Awards ceremony are no longer attended by senior singers, and even television stations are absent from the broadcast, which all illustrate the decline of the Hong Kong music scene.
        </p>

        <p>
          Behind the glamour, this pop music industry base has actually been facing internal and external difficulties for a long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          As soon as the traditional record company segment went down, the Hong Kong pop music industry, which was half supported by them, started to go downhill. In addition to the 1997 Asian financial turmoil, which led to a major economic downturn and the bankruptcy of many Hong Kong record companies, rampant piracy was also a major factor that had a huge impact on the record market.
        </p>

        <div class = "multimedia">
          <img src = "../prijmedia/HKalburm.jpeg" alt = "Hong Kong Alburm">
        </div>


        <p>
          In addition to such internal problems, external problems make Canton-pop unable to fight. The Korean culture in Asia, represented by film, television and music, and the explosion of talent shows in the mainland have brought a constant impact on the Hong Kong music scene.

          On the other hand, the post-millennium music scene in Hong Kong was plagued with bad news, and many of the mainstays of the music industry died young. Thus, before the smooth transition of old and new artists, Hong Kong pop music was caught in an awkward period where there was a shortage of quality musicians and music productions.
        </p>

        <p>
          And at this time, the rise of Mandarin-pop creation and the new wave of Taiwanese-pop coming in made the overall migration of the music center of the mainland, gradually moving northward from the coastal area of Guangzhou. And this became the last straw that crushed Cantonese-pop. Under the tremendous pressure to survive, many Hong Kong pop singers operating in the mainland were forced to transform into multi-instrumentalists.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How did the golden age of Canton pop come about?</h2>
        <p>
          The glory of Cantonese-language pop music at the end of the last century is now gone. What is beyond doubt is its significance to the history of contemporary Chinese pop music and the healthy development of the mainland music industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          A diverse cultural environment is the best ground for creativity. A review of Cantonese-pop's history reveals that, compared to Chinese music, Cantonese lyrics are rich in vocal variations, making it easier to make diverse attempts to match the melody. On the other hand, influenced by the integrated values of Chinese and Western fusion, Cantonese-pop songs have a variety of themes, not limited to love themes, and usually convey more emotions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nowadays, Cantonese-pop has entered the mainland music market for many years. As music becomes more and more commoditized, and record companies tend to take the taste of the market audience as their creative criteria, it is time for Cantonese musicians to boldly try to present fresh themes.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's not hard to write pop songs that are popular love songs, but it's not easy to write pop songs that have the unique charm of Cantonese-pop. Fortunately, being born at the center of the collision between Chinese and Western cultures, Cantonese-pop usually has the two-way expression of pursuing hedonism and longing for roots. This is the reason why Cantonese pop songs are so popular and widely distributed in mainland China, and it is also the advantage of Cantonese-pop over other Chinese music works. This is also evident from the popularity of similarly diverse works such as "If I Were Eason Chan" and "Leave White" among Eason Chan's fans.

        <p>
          The more winter there is in the Cantonese song industry, the more it needs to burn the fire of Cantonese songwriting to help it revive. Hong Kong's diverse cultural environment has always given singers and creators more inspiration and sentiment, and is the best vessel for cultivating excellent independent music, while the half of the mountain laid down by the previous generation has given the new generation of musicians enough space to cross the times, seek the commonality of the classics, and return to the heart of creating Cantonese songs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, the growth of an independent ecology is an intrinsic motivation. The era of record company domination has passed. With new music production technology in hand and a new music distribution process in hand, how to make the most of Hong Kong's free and developed market economy to release the vitality of individuals and economic institutions in the market may be a point that Canton-pop needs to focus on. Only by allowing Canton-pop to stop being an appendage of Hong Kong's media industry and to explore new ways of expression as an independent art form, can the Hong Kong pop music industry truly belong to its original position and come closer to the possibility of returning to spring.
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>
        In his doctoral dissertation, James Wong, a famous composer and lyricist, said, "The biggest reason why Hong Kong pop music can sell well on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is because of the freedom of Hong Kong. Then as Taiwan opened up and the mainland opened up, the gap between the three places became less and less, and the popularity of Hong Kong songs decreased accordingly."
        </p>

        <p>
        That's certainly true. However, the younger generation of local musicians in Hong Kong have begun to explore themselves, and the city, which is full of Bauhinia, still retains the vitality of Asia's top commercial center, and has shown us new possibilities. As for Cantonese pop music, it is silent, fumbling, and waiting for a new explosion.
