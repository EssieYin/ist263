        <p>
            I am currently an senior majoring in Applied Data Analytics in iSchool of Syracuse University and I have decided to focus on Data Science. In my opinion, extracting insight from raw data is exciting. I always see the process of learning DA as the stage mode of a virtual game. I consistently learned Data Analytics tools. Below are my core skills.
